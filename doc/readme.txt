create_database - creates wifi database used to perform fingerprinting requires iwlist text output stored in files with the following file name structure: scanX-Y where X is the sequence number and Y is the scan number (See example scan data in scan10.zip on garcia_misc cd)

	Usage: create_database <num_refpoints> <num_scans>

create_graph - creates data required for shortest path calculation

The following is used to generate a default graph.txt file which can be modified by hand. After generating a graph.txt file evoking the program without command line parameters will generate the graph.bin file from the graph.txt file

Usage: create_graph --default [distance]

create_heatmap - creates heatmap bitmap image from database.bin, simply give it an access point name exactly as printed in the raw iwlist_data and it will generate an image from that data. Use subdivide graph to generate higher resolution images and scale them appropriately. (scale is an integer that multiplies image dimensions)

Usage: create_heatmap <Access Point> [scale]

subdivide database - doubles database size by interpolating new values between existing values. I dont recommend using this program for anything other than generating higher resolution heatmap images.

iwlist_meet - used to connect to iwlist_listen program, collect locations, and send meet command.

iwlist_listen - runs on robots and waits for commands from iwlist_meet program.

iwlist_match - performs wifi fingerprinting using database

laser_parse - converts given raw polar coordinate laser txt data generated by iwlist_laser into single laser.bin file with cartensian coordinates

laser_plot - displays data stored in laser.bin
	mousewheel - zoom level
	shift + mousewheel - shifts in x direction
	control + mousewheel - shifts in y direction
	right mouse button - rotates



iwlist_laser - collects raw polar coordinate laser data from laser and stores to given file name.


iwlist_fake - used to fake iwlist_listen for testing purposes

iwlist_drive - used to cause robots to drive given starting and ending locations. Optional scan mode performs both scanning between each step and dynamic obstacle avoidance.

i2c_compass - reads all available compass data
