# THIS FILE IS NOT REQUIRED TO RUN THE aLaser PROGRAM

### linktype - Tells the program what type of link is being used.
#            Options are serial, ip
#            If a laser model is capable of serial communication, the 
#            application will increase the baudrate to a maximum rate
#            to improve refresh rates of the laser. 
#
linktype = serial

#### for serial linktype
# portname - Tells the program which port to communicate with the laser.
#            Defaults for Mac OS and Linux are: tty.usbmodem1d11 
#            Default for Windos is COM4 
#            On Unix, you may use 'ls /dev' to find the port.
#            Values are case sensitive and must be typed correctly. 
#            For example, "com1" is not the same as "COM1".
#
portname = ttyACM0

#### for serial linktype only
# baudrate - This determines the speed of data transmission over
#            the serial connection.  The default for the Laser is
#            9600, and other options are 2400, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 and
#            115200.
#
#baudrate = 9600

### for adjusting the buadrate
# final_laser_serial_baudrate - This determines the speed the laser 
#            will operate at over the serial connection. This setting 
#            does not do anything when using the USB connection. Laser
#            models that do have RS232 communcation will make a change
#            to the communication that happens with the laser. Options 
#            are 2400, 9600, 57600 and 115200. The default (and setting
#            here) is 115200. 
#
# final_laser_serial_baudrate = 115200

#### for ip linktype
# ip_address - Tells the program what ip address the laser is located on.
#              This is currenly only an IP4 address in the format
#              XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.  This address is typically the address
#              of the machine acting as the IP relay.
#
# ip_address = 127.0.0.1

#### for ip linktype
# ip_port - Tells the program what ip port the laser is located on.
#           This is typically a number above 6000 isn't limited to
#           a range.
#
# ip_port = 8000

### for minimum reading step index
# minimum_step - This value tells the laser what minimum index value to
#           start scanning from. Default will vary between lasers. This 
#           value is set dynamically during a laser object initialization.
#           By changing the value in this file, the minimum step index
#           will be adjusted appropriately. 
#
# minimum_step = 0

### for minimum reading step index
# maximum_step - This value tells the laser what maximum index value to
#           start scanning from. Default will vary between lasers. This 
#           value is set dynamically during a laser object initialization.
#           By changing the value in this file, the maximum step index
#           will be adjusted appropriately. 
#
# maximum_step = 0

### for using different SCIP protocols
# protocol - Tells the laser to use a different SCIP protocol. The default
#           value is 2.0, but for certain laser types can be set to 1.0.
#           Using SCIP 1.0 will limit functionality with the laser. 
#
# protocol = 2.0
