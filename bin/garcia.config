# To change a parameter, (1) remove the '#' before the parameter to

# linktype - Tells the program what type of link is being used.
#            Options are serial, usb, ip
#            The Default is serial. When doing relays, ip is used.
#            The usb type is for newer BrainStem modules currently
#            in development.
 linktype = serial



#### for serial linktype
# portname - Tells the program which port to listen for the Brainstem.
#            Defaults are: printer for MacOS, COM1 for Windows, ttyS1 
#            for Linux, and serial for PalmOS. On Mac, you may use
#            'ls /dev' to find the port.
#            Values are case sensitive and must be typed correctly. 
#            For example, "com1" is not the same as "COM1".
#
portname = ttyS1

#### for serial linktype
# baudrate - This determines the speed of data transmission over
#            the serial connection.  The default for the Brainstem is
#            9600, and other options are 2400, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 and
#            115200.  The baudrate should typically be kept at 9600
#            for sucessful communication with the BrainStem.
#
baudrate = 38400



#### for usb linktype
# usb_id - Tells the program what the serial number of the brainstem
#          is that will be communicated with.  This id is unique for
#          each brainstem.  The default is 0 (invalid).  This number
#          is shown on the usb-based Brainstem itself and is typically
#          entered in hexidecimal format.
#
# usb_id = 0x00000000



#### for ip linktype
# ip_address - Tells the program what ip address the stem is located on.
#              This is currenly only an IP4 address in the format
#              XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX.  This address is typically the address
#              of the machine acting as the IP relay.
#
# ip_address = 129.120.3.14

#### for ip linktype
# ip_port - Tells the program what ip port the stem is located on.
#           This is typically a number above 6000 isn't limited to
#           a range.
#
# ip_port = 9000
